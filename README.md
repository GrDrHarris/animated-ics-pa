# nju-projectn.github.com/ics-pa-gitbook

This version of ics-pa is inspired by the [OS Lab 2023](https://git.nju.edu.cn/oslab2023/oslab/-/wikis/Home) for the common classes.Why can't we create a animated version of ics-pa?

Therefore, we forked the origin repo of ics-pa and make some changes.

Please access [here](https://nju-projectn.github.io/ics-pa-gitbook) for all the lecture notes.

NOTE: This repo is updated by forced push.
Run `bash update.sh` to keep the repo up-to-date.
